Updated metric names and units
==============================

v1.0.0:
- metric names follow the original naming convention for mod_iostat
- values reported are in KB not Bytes, so you might see `K' twice in the
  rrd graph (and if you see K twice, it means you are looking at MBytes)

v1.1.0:
- metric names follow the convention of ganglia-modules-solaris
  (similar to names in kstat, e.g. io_nwrite = number of bytes written)
- values reported in unscaled units (bytes and seconds) rather than
  in KB and milliseconds

modmulticpu
===========

This version of modmulticpu is based on the original module contributed
by Brad Nicholes to the main Ganglia tree.

It has been enhanced to access the array of CPU data in a more efficient
manner.

Building
========

Sample configure command for building the modules:

export GANGLIA_HOME=/usr/src/ganglia-3.1.7

./configure \
  CFLAGS="`apr-1-config --cflags --includes` -I${GANGLIA_HOME}/include/ -I${GANGLIA_HOME}/lib/ -I${GANGLIA_HOME}/libmetrics/" \
  --enable-shared --disable-static
